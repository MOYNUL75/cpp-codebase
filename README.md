# CPP Codebase
Welcome to **cpp-codebase**, a comprehensive repository of C++ programs, projects, and practice exercises. This repository is designed for learning, improving, and showcasing proficiency in C++ programming, covering everything from fundamental concepts to advanced problem-solving. A comprehensive C++ repository with programs, projects, and algorithms for learning, practice, and portfolio showcase.

---

## 🔹 Features
- **C++ Basics:** Syntax, data types, control structures, functions  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):** Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting, searching  
- **Project Examples:** Real-world C++ projects demonstrating practical applications  
- **Modern C++ Concepts:** Smart pointers, STL (Standard Template Library), file handling, exception handling  

---

## 🔹 Purpose
This repository serves multiple purposes:
1. **Learning & Practice:** A structured place to experiment and practice C++ coding.  
2. **Portfolio:** Showcase your C++ projects and problem-solving skills to employers or recruiters.  
3. **Reference:** Acts as a personal reference for C++ concepts and reusable code snippets.

If you want, I can also **create the folder structure and add example starter files** (`basics`, `oop`, `dsa`, `projects`) so you can push everything at once—it will look **super professional on GitHub**.  

Do you want me to do that next?
